	<h2>About Ralph</h2>
	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRalph... well, who is Ralph? That's a good one. <br> <span>Not only the 2024's Building Wreckers League MVP, he's a good guy. Ralph is the very opposite of a bad guy, but he most definitely looks like one. As a big guy with a soft&nbsp;heart, Ralph has rescued hundreds of Yoshi's eggs, all scattered and abandoned throughout a land of an unemployed evil dictator/plumber, and has personaly cooked them all together, to feed thousands of scared little ghosts trapped on the Pac man's real estate. </span> </p>
